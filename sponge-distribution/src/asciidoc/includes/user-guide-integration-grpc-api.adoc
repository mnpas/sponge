= {sponge} gRPC API
The {sponge} gRPC API allows users to remotely subscribe to {sponge} events.

The gRPC has been chosen to provide event subscriptions because the main {sponge} Remote API has limited options for push notifications. The {sponge} gRPC API can be seen as an addition to the {sponge} Remote API.

NOTE: Events are pushed online, i.e. if a client subscribes to an event type, only events that come after that time will be delivered.

== Operations summary
The following table contains a summary of the gRPC API operations.

|===
|Name |URI |Description

|Get the Sponge Remote API version
|`GetVersion`
|Returns the Sponge Remote API version.

|Subscribe events
|`Subscribe`
|Subscribes to {sponge} events and returns a stream of events.

|Subscribe events and manage a subscription
|`SubscribeManaged`
|Subscribes to {sponge} events and returns a stream of events. A subscription is managed by a stream of requests. This operation uses bidirectional steaming and is not supported in https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/[web gRPC clients].

== Configuration
The convention is that the gRPC server port is the Remote API port plus `1`, e.g. if the Remote API port is `8080` then the gRPC API port will be `8081`.

A web gRPC client requires a https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/web/[proxy] to forward a gRPC browser request to a backend {sponge} gRPC service. In that case the convention is that the proxy port is the Remote API port plus `2`.

== Error handling
An application error is returned to a client in a response message, just like in the Remote API. An internal error is returned as a gRPC exception with a status.
