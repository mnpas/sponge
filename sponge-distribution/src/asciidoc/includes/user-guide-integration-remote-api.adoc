= {sponge} Remote API
The {sponge} Remote API provides users a remote access to the key {sponge} functionalities.

== Endpoints
The {sponge} Remote API supports a JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint and method endpoints that support simplified JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

The reason that the API supports both styles is that the JSON-RPC 2.0 compatibility is intended for applications that connect to {sponge} while the less strict JSON-RPC 2.0 API is rather intended for manual, command-line uses.

=== JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint
The main Remote API `/jsonrpc` endpoint is intended to be JSON-RPC 2.0 compatible.

=== Method endpoints
The other endpoints correspond to the supported Remote API methods and provide an RPC style API based on JSON-RPC 2.0 that adopts some REST concepts:

* a request doesn't have to contain a method name (because it is is defined by a particular endpoint),
* it uses different endpoints for different methods like REST.

The method endpoints metadata is used when the OpenAPI specification for the service is generated.

== Methods summary
The following table contains a summary of the Remote API methods. For a complete specification see the <<_swagger_overview, specification>> generated using Swagger and https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup].

.The Remote API methods summary
[cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Name |Method |Description

|Get the Sponge Remote API version
|`version`
|Returns the Sponge Remote API version if it is set in the configuration, otherwise returns the {sponge} engine version.

|Get the API features
|`features`
|Returns the API features.

|Login
|`login`
|User login. Used in a token-based authentication scenario.

|Logout
|`logout`
|User logout. Used in a token-based authentication scenario.

|Get knowledge bases
|`knowledgeBases`
|Returns the knowledge bases which the user may use (i.e. may call actions registered in these knowledge basses).

|Get actions
|`actions`
|Returns the metadata of actions that are available to the user. If you want to get metadata for specified actions, set the request property `name` to an action name or a Java-compatible regular expression. If you want to get only actions that have argument and result metadata specified in their configuration, set the request property `metadataRequired` to `true` (defaults to `false`). Actions will be sorted by a category sequence number, a knowledge base sequence number and an action label or name. The sequence number reflects the order in which categories or knowledge bases have been added to the engine. The optional request property `registeredTypes` is a flag for requesting registered types used in the actions in the result (defaults to `false`).

|Call an action
|`call`
|Calls an action.

|Provide action arguments
|`actionArgs`
|Returns _provided arguments_, i.e. values along with value sets of action arguments. The request accepts the following properties: `name` - the action name, `argNames` -  the optional list of argument names that are to be provided (if `null`, all provided arguments will be produced), `current` - the optional map of argument names and their current values passed from a client code.

|Send a new event
|`send`
|Sends a new event.

|Get event types
|`eventTypes`
|Returns the registered event types.

|Reload knowledge bases
|`reload`
|Reloads all knowledge bases. Depending on the configuration, this method may not be published. It should be available only to administrators.
|===

The OpenAPI specification of the Remote API is included in the Appendix A of the {sponge} Reference Documentation.

The {sponge} Remote API service can publish custom Remote API methods as well.

In case of an error, a response HTTP status code will be `500`.

== OpenAPI specification
An online API specification in the https://swagger.io[OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)] JSON format will be available, depending on the configuration, at URL `http://localhost:1836/doc`.

NOTE: The generated OpenAPI specification is currently limited. For example it doesn't support inheritance e.g. for {sponge} data types. Therefore it is most useful for customized methods.

== Request
A request may contain base properties.

.Base request properties
[cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Name |Required |Description

|`header`
|No
|A request header.

|`body`
|No
|A request body.
|===

.Request header properties
[cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Name |Required |Description

|`id`
|No
|A request identifier. If it is present, the response will contain a header with same `id` property with the same value. This feature provides some compatibility with the JSON-RPC protocol.

|`username`
|No
|A username that may be used in a user/password authentication mode. In that case, if there is no username present, the _anonumous_ user is assumed.

|`password`
|No
|A user password that may be used in a user/password authentication mode.

|`authToken`
|No
|An authentication token that may be used in a token-based authentication mode.

|`features`
|No
|Request features that will be saved in a Remote API session.
|===

The request features can be used for:

* Setting a requested language if a knowledge base supports it.
* Sending an API key to the service. For example, on the server side you could add an `OnSessionOpenListener` implementing the `onSessionOpen(RemoteApiSession session)` method that checks a value of `session.getFeatures().get("apiKey")`. If the API key is incorrect an exception will be thrown.

NOTE: Request and response features are not converted by the feature converter.

The {sponge} Remote API supports both POST and GET methods.

== Security

=== Authentication mode
The Remote API supports a username/password and an authentication token authentication modes.

.Authentication modes
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name |Description

|Username/password
|Every request has to contain a username and a password. Invoking the `login` method switches to the authentication token mode.

|Authentication token
|Every request has to contain an authentication token, returned by the `login` method that has to be invoked earlier. It may not contain neither username nor password. The authentication token has an expiration time. When a method returns an error message with an error code `INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN` you have to invoke the `login` method once more to obtain a new authentication token.
