= {sponge} REST API
The {sponge} REST API provides users a remote access to the key {sponge} functionalities.

== Operations summary
The following table contains a summary of the REST API operations. For a complete list of operations see the <<_swagger_overview, specification>> generated using Swagger and https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup].

.The REST API operations summary
[cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Name |URI |Description

|Get the Sponge version
|`version`
|Returns the Sponge version.

|Get the API features
|`features`
|Returns the API features.

|Login
|`login`
|User login. Used in a token-based authentication scenario.

|Logout
|`logout`
|User logout. Used in a token-based authentication scenario.

|Get knowledge bases
|`knowledgeBases`
|Returns the knowledge bases which the user may use (i.e. may call actions registered in these knowledge basses).

|Get actions
|`actions`
|Returns the metadata of actions that are available to the user. If you want to get metadata for specified actions, set the request property `name` to an action name or a Java-compatible regular expression. If you want to get only actions that have argument and result metadata specified in their configuration, set the request property `metadataRequired` to `true` (defaults to `false`). Actions will be sorted by a category sequence number, a knowledge base sequence number and an action label or name. The sequence number reflects the order in which categories or knowledge bases have been added to the engine. The optional request property `registeredTypes` is a flag for requesting registered types used in the actions in the result (defaults to `false`).

|Call an action
|`call`
|Calls an action.

|Provide action arguments
|`actionArgs`
|Returns _provided arguments_, i.e. values along with value sets of action arguments. The request accepts the following properties: `name` - the action name, `argNames` -  the optional list of argument names that are to be provided (if `null`, all provided arguments will be produced), `current` - the optional map of argument names and their current values passed from a client code.

|Send a new event
|`send`
|Sends a new event.

|Get event types
|`eventTypes`
|Returns the registered event types.

|Reload knowledge bases
|`reload`
|Reloads all knowledge bases. Depending on the configuration, this operation may not be published. It should be available only to administrators.
|===

The OpenAPI specification of the REST API is included in the Appendix A of the {sponge} Reference Documentation.

The {sponge} REST API service can publish custom REST API operations as well.

In case of an error, a response HTTP status code will be `500`.

== OpenAPI specification
An online API specification in the https://swagger.io[OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)] JSON format will be available, depending on the configuration, at URL `http://localhost:1836/sponge.json/v1/doc`.

NOTE: The generated OpenAPI specification is currently limited. For example it doesn't support inheritance e.g. for {sponge} data types. Therefore it is most useful for simple customized operations.

== Request
A request may contain base properties.

.Base request properties
[cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Name |Required |Description

|`header`
|No
|A request header.

|`body`
|No
|A request body.
|===

.Request header properties
[cols="2,1,4"]
|===
|Name |Required |Description

|`id`
|No
|A request identifier. If it is present, the response will contain a header with same `id` property with the same value. This feature provides some compatibility with the JSON-RPC protocol.

|`username`
|No
|A user name that may be used in a user/password authentication mode. In that case, if there is no user name present, the _anonumous_ user is assumed.

|`password`
|No
|A user password that may be used in a user/password authentication mode.

|`authToken`
|No
|An authentication token that may be used in a token-based authentication mode.

|`features`
|No
|Request features that will be saved in a REST API session. They can be used for example to set a language if a knowledge base supports it.
|===

The {sponge} REST API supports both POST and GET methods.

== Security

=== Authentication mode
The REST API supports a username/password and an authentication token authentication modes.

.Authentication modes
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name |Description

|Username/password
|Every request has to contain a username and a password. Invoking the `login` operation switches to the authentication token mode.

|Authentication token
|Every request has to contain an authentication token, returned by the `login` operation that has to be invoked earlier. It may not contain neither username nor password. The authentication token has an expiration time. When an operation returns an error message with an error code `INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN` you have to invoke the `login` operation once more to obtain a new authentication token.
|===

== Error codes

.REST API error codes
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Code |Description

|`GENERIC`
|A generic error.

|`INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN`
|Invalid or expired authentication token.

|`INVALID_KB_VERSION`
|An action version in the engine differs from the one passed to the REST API from a client code.

|`INVALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD`
|Invalid username or password.

|`INACTIVE_ACTION`
|An action to be called is inactive.
