= {sponge} Remote API client for Dart
The {sponge} Remote API client for Dart simplifies connecting to a remote {sponge} Remote API service from applications written in Dart. It could be used in a https://flutter.io[Flutter] mobile application or an https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular[AngularDart] web application to connect to a {sponge} based back-end. The Remote API client uses POST methods.

IMPORTANT: The fully featured {sponge} Remote API client is the client for *Dart*. Clients for other languages may have less features.

.Remote API client example
[source,dart]
----
import 'package:sponge_client_dart/sponge_client_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create a new client for an anonymous user.
  var client = SpongeClient(
      SpongeClientConfiguration('http://localhost:8888'));

  // Get the Sponge Remote API version.
  var version = await client.getVersion();
  print('Sponge Remote API version: $version.');

  // Get actions metadata.
  List<ActionMeta> actionsMeta = await client.getActions();
  print('Available action count: ${actionsMeta.length}.');

  // Call the action with arguments.
  String upperCaseText = await client.call('UpperCase', args: ['Text to upper case']);
  print('Upper case text: $upperCaseText.');

  // Send a new event to the Sponge engine.
  var eventId = await client.send('alarm',
      attributes: {'source': 'Dart client', 'message': 'Something happened'});
  print('Sent event id: $eventId.');

  // Create a new client for a named user.
  client = SpongeClient(
    SpongeClientConfiguration('http://localhost:8888')
      ..username = 'john'
      ..password = 'password',
  );
}

Unless noted otherwise in the release notes, versions of the Remote API client for Dart that have the same `major.minor` numbers as the {sponge} version are compatible. Note that the Sponge Remote API version can be different than the {sponge} version.

The Remote API client for Dart is published as `sponge_client_dart` at https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/sponge_client_dart[pub.dartlang.org].

For more information see the {dartClientDartdoc}/SpongeClient-class.html[`SpongeResClient` Dartdoc] and the project {dartClientSourcesUrl}/[source code].

The example of using the Remote API client for Dart in the AngularDart web application is hosted at https://github.com/softelnet/sponge_client_angular_dart_example.
